Purpose: This application was created to give a company's users the ability to schedule appointments with customers from across the globe.

Directions: First run the program. Then enter a valid username and password. Next you'll be directed to the Scheduling screen which will give you
the option of adding, updating, and deleting appointments via buttons. When an option is clicked you will be prompted to input data in the associated
fields. Congrats, you've just used the scheduling application to schedule appointments!

Section A3f: The purpose of my additional report labeled "Appointments by Contact & Year & Total" is just that, to document contacts by their name, total appointments,
and year the contact was created.
